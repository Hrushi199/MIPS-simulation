# MIPS Simulation

A lightweight Python-based simulator for the MIPS architecture, designed to execute MIPS machine code instructions.  
This project serves as an educational tool to understand the inner workings of MIPS processors.

## Features

- Simulates a subset of MIPS instructions
- Processes binary machine code directly
- Modular and easy-to-understand Python implementation
- Includes sample assembly and machine code files for testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hrushi199/MIPS-simulation.git
cd MIPS-simulation
```

2. **Prepare your machine code:**

Place your MIPS machine code (in binary format) into the `input` array within the `processor.py` file.

### Running the Simulator

Run the simulator using Python:

```bash
python processor.py
```

The simulator will process the instructions provided in the `input` array and output the results accordingly.
